# kubics-console
Kubic's console allows cross-platform usage of a custom made console with the vulkan API. 


this library makes its own console window(referred to as "kubic's console") instead of using the one
given to it by the OS(referred to as "standard console") 


this includes:

-simple input and output to kubic's console

-colorize the text that is on the screen

-customize the font within kubic's console(size, style, etc.)

-rendering of sprites


using kubic's console will allow more simplistic usage of a console window
without having to learn the windows API or some barely documented library
to colorize some text on a standard console window.

if you like making games within the console this is something I suggest to use.

all of its dependcies are included inside of this repository itself.
So downloading or installing any additional dependcies for this library is not needed.

generate the project with cmake and use a build system and compiler of your choice.
